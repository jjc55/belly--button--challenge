# Module 14 Challenge JavaScript Belly Button Challenge

In this challenge, I built an interactive dashboard (see link below) on microbes within the human navel. To build this dashboard, I used JavaScript and the D3 and Plotly library. I started by developing a horizontal bar chart, then a bubble chart, metadata featuring an individual's demographic information, and lastly a gauge chart.
