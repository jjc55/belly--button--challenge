# Belly Button Challenge
### Module 14 Challenge: JavaScript 

In this challenge, I built an interactive dashboard based on a dataset on microbes within the human navel. To build this dashboard, I used JavaScript and the D3 and Plotly library. I started by developing a horizontal bar chart and a bubble chart on the type and quantity of microbial species, sample metadata featuring an individual's demographic information, and lastly a gauge chart on belly button washing frequency.
